# Pico ESP01 MP

A micropython library for using ESP01 modules with the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller as a WiFi client.

**Very** heavily based on the Adafruit CircuitPython ESP library. Amateurly hacked and modified for client-only connectivity with standard and Pimoroni MicroPython flavours.

Adding a line locally on the Pi400
